# of-hashtags-and-congress
Data and code for my thesis, submitted to the University of Michigan
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of
HONORS BACHELOR OF ARTS, Department of Political Science.

I examine what hashtag use by members of Congress might represent,
what predictive qualities hashtag use might have as an indicator
of political priorities and thus voting behavior, how hashtag usage
varies between parties, and how hashtags have become part of a
repertoire of political communication strategies.

I find that members of Congress tend to use the same hashtags as other
members who are similar to them in terms of partisanship, home state,
and voting behavior. Additionally, strategy varies between parties â€“
while similar hashtag usage is a meaningful predictor of similar
congressional voting patterns for Democrats, this is not true for
Republicans.
